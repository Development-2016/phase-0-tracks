RELEASE 2: Execute SQL Queries

1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

sqlite> SELECT * FROM houses;
1|555 Nowhere|100000|1
2|154 Whocares st.|250000|2
3|981 W Road|5000000|3

2.Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense)

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT price FROM houses WHERE price > 100000;
250000
5000000

4.Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT houses.location, classification.type_of_house FROM houses JOIN classification ON houses.class_id = classification.id;
555 Nowhere|traditional
154 Whocares st.|modern
981 W Road|luxury

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> DELETE FROM houses WHERE price < 150000;
sqlite> SELECT * FROM houses;
2|154 Whocares st.|250000|2
3|981 W Road|5000000|3

sqlite> SELECT classification.type_of_house, houses.location FROM houses INNER JOIN classification ON houses.id=classification.id;
modern|154 Whocares st.
luxury|981 W Road

sqlite> SELECT houses.id,houses.location, houses.price, classification.type_of_house FROM houses LEFT JOIN classification ON houses.class_id=classification.id;
2|154 Whocares st.|250000|modern
3|981 W Road|5000000|luxury
sqlite>
