# 9.1 How the Web Works

1. What are some common HTTP Status Codes?
200 = OK
201 = Created
204 = No Content
304 = Not Modified
400 = Bad Request
401 = Unauthorized
403 = Forbidden
404 = Not Found
409 = Conflict

2. What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

A GET request is used to read a resource, while POST creates a resource. The GET method is only used to read the data and not change it, so it is safer with less risk of modification or corruption. The POST method creates new resources so it is not safe.

3. What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in the user's web browser while the user is browsing. It is a realiable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information or record the user's browsing activity.
